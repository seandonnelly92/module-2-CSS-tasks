_This project was created for module 1 of the Front End Development bootcamp. In this challenge, we were tasked with refactoring code to make it more accessible for a fictional digital consultancy called Horiseon._


# Sean's Porftolio Project

## Description

This page was created to document my journey learning to code. It's partly a log of the modules I am working through and partly a place to showcase my best work.

The website summarises the activites I have completed and includes snippets about what I learnt during each activity, which will allow me to go back into those applications when I inevitably need a refresher on a topic in the future. 

It has been written in a very traditional way with basic HTML and CSS. 

Building this simple website has helped me practise and refine my knowledge of some web development fundamentals. One learning that stands out is that there are so many ways to achieve the same outcome. I look forward to learning more about optimisation and efficient coding. Something I have to improve on is speed!

3. Navigate to your downloads folder an Unzip the repository folder. 
4. Move whole folder to a location where you want your project to be stored locally.
5. Open Visual Studio Code
6. Click File > Open Folder...

8. Select the folder
9. Click Open
10. Now you can work on the codebase locally! 

## Usage

Functionality is limited on the website, it mostly just displays information. The nav bar does contain five links: one is the logo which just redirects to the homepage. This will only be useful in future if other pages are added and the nav bar is updated. The other four links in the nav bar are internal anchor tags that scroll the relevant section on the homepage. 

Here is a screenshot of the live website:
